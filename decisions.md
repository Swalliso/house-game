# Open House — Decision Log

Our game jam entry for the theme **"It's a house."** A one-week jam with friends, built with Claude Code.

**How to use this file:** each entry is one decision with a status. Update the status instead of deleting entries. When a decision changes, mark the old entry *Superseded* and point to its replacement.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Accepted | Agreed; build on it |
| Proposed | Suggested, waiting on a yes or no |
| Parked | Good idea, deliberately deferred |
| Open | Needs a decision |

## The game in one paragraph

You run a home-building company. Each run is one contract: one client, one plot of land, one house. Every week you place one piece (a room or a yard feature), and every piece on the lot earns score each week based on what it touches. Every few weeks there's a milestone with a target that rises each time; miss it and the client fires you. Hit it with weeks to spare and you choose between completing the milestone early for a bonus or using the remaining weeks to keep building. Between milestones you spend budget in a shop. Each client judges the house in their own way, and change orders shake things up mid-run.

## Accepted

### D-001 · Concept: Open House
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** A roguelite house-building engine-builder: place rooms and yard pieces on a lot, chase combos, hit rising targets.
**Why:** The best hook for the build risk of the four pitches, and the most literal take on the theme.
**Considered:** *Do Not Disturb* (you are the house, protecting your sleeping family from burglars), *Chicken Legs* (FTL-style walking house), *Housesitter* (anomaly hunt).

### D-002 · Top-down map view
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** The lot is shown top-down on a grid, similar to Combolands.

### D-003 · One client, one lot, one house per run
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** The house persists through every milestone of a run, and the client stays the same.
**Why:** Players can commit to a specialized build, no later evaluator punishes earlier choices, and each run has a clear identity.
**Considered:** A new buyer every round. Rejected because it forces generic houses and needs a story patch for why buyers don't just buy the house.

### D-004 · Weekly earning
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Each week is one turn in which you place one piece. Every placed piece earns every week, so early placements earn more over time.

### D-005 · Milestones with rising targets
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Every few weeks the accumulated score must reach a target, and targets rise each milestone. Missing one ends the run (the client fires you).

### D-006 · Early completion
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Once a milestone's target is met with weeks to spare, the player can complete it early for a bonus (budget for each week saved, plus a score bonus) or keep building through the remaining weeks to get more pieces down.
**Why:** A real greed-versus-growth decision. Modeled on Combolands' "Complete milestone early" button (see `research.md`).
**Proposed addition:** an auto-complete toggle for players who want to skip the decision.

### D-007 · The yard is part of the build
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** The lot includes both the house and the yard. Yard pieces are first-class, and every tile is a choice between house and yard.

### D-008 · Open House is its own game, not a reskin
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Keep these house-specific ideas central:
- Rooms have real floor-plan shapes.
- Groups of rooms score like poker hands (e.g., a Suite, a Full House).
- Scoring follows real-world floor-plan intuition (bedrooms want quiet, kitchens want dining rooms), and clients bend those rules.
- "-house" outbuildings: doghouse, treehouse, greenhouse, and so on.

### D-009 · Framing: you're the building company
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** The player runs a home-building company that takes contracts. Each contract is a plot of land with unique features plus a client with specifications. Not a realtor or sales game.

### D-010 · Clients differ in flavor, not necessarily difficulty
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** A client like the vampire should feel different from a typical 4-bed, 2-bath family, not just harder.

### D-011 · Change orders
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Mid-run, the client makes new requests that push the player to adapt.

### D-012 · Crews
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** At the start of a run the player picks a builder or crew with its own strengths and focus (the equivalent of Combolands' guilds).

### D-013 · Shop between milestones
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Budget earned from milestones and early completions is spent in a shop between milestones.

### D-014 · v1 is building for the client
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** The first build focuses on constructing the house for a client. Renovation modes wait (see Parked).

### D-026 · Everyday clients are common; eccentrics are rare
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Most clients have everyday but varied needs (a family, dog owners, a remote worker, a minimalist). Eccentric clients like the vampire show up rarely, as a fun surprise.
**Why:** Varied needs drive replayability, and rare eccentrics stay special.

## Proposed

### D-015 · Start small, grow into the corporation
**Status:** Proposed
The company starts as a two-person outfit with a pickup truck, and growing it is the meta-progression. Players name their company, and the name shows up next to shared scores.

### D-016 · Unlocks over power
**Status:** Proposed
Meta-progression unlocks new crews, clients, and pieces rather than permanent stat boosts, so runs stay challenging. The currency is Reputation, earned from finished jobs, with a bonus for early completions.

### D-017 · Difficulty is a separate setting
**Status:** Proposed
Contract difficulty tiers add HOA rules, rush jobs (fewer weeks), and tight budgets (a pricier shop), independent of which client you get.

### D-018 · Milestones are construction phases
**Status:** Proposed
Groundbreaking → Foundation → Framing → Roofing → Drywall → Finishes → Final Walkthrough. Each milestone is a client walkthrough.

### D-019 · Score name
**Status:** Proposed
Working name **Wow**. Alternatives: Delight, Charm.

### D-020 · Pieces built from tags and effect types
**Status:** Proposed
Every piece has tags (Quiet, Loud, Social, Wet, Sunny, Outdoor, Kid, Pet, Green, Dark, …) and effects built from a small shared set of effect types. Clients, change orders, HOA rules, and shop upgrades target tags, so new content is mostly data. See `content-brainstorm.md`.

### D-021 · Client spec checklist
**Status:** Proposed
Each client has a short spec checklist (e.g., 4 Bedrooms, 2 Bathrooms, a Fenced Yard), and each item met multiplies weekly score. Together with the client's tastes, this is how clients judge the house differently.

### D-022 · Daily Lot
**Status:** Proposed
The same lot, client, and card draws for everyone each day, with a shorter run and a copyable result line for the group chat.

### D-023 · One extra floor at most for the jam: the basement
**Status:** Proposed
Floors are layers on the same grid with a floor switcher, with the other floor shown faded for reference. The staircase is a piece you draft. Basement only, and only as a stretch goal.

### D-024 · Endless mode after the Final Walkthrough
**Status:** Proposed
After winning, keep going with rising targets and more change orders. Nearly free if the milestone system keeps generating phases.

### D-025 · House data separate from run data
**Status:** Proposed
Keeps the door open for a future renovation mode that starts from an existing house.

### D-027 · Tech defaults
**Status:** Proposed
TypeScript + Vite. The game rules live in a pure TypeScript module with no rendering code, covered by unit tests, with a thin rendering layer on top (Phaser is a good fit for the board and animations; settle this during planning). Seeded randomness from day one. Static hosting (itch.io or GitHub Pages) so friends can play from a link. Where the repo's existing conventions differ, follow the repo.

### D-028 · Score accumulates across the run
**Status:** Proposed
One running total, with each milestone at a higher total, shown as a single progress bar with phase markers. Weekly earnings are never wasted, so choosing to keep building instead of completing early always adds to the total.

### D-029 · Jam scope and starting numbers
**Status:** Proposed
See `jam-scope.md` for what's in, what's stretch, what's out, placeholder numbers, and a suggested build order.

### D-030 · Placeholder art first
**Status:** Proposed
Build with simple shapes and labels until the core loop is fun, then do an art and sound pass. CC0 asset packs are fine for the jam.

### D-031 · Client rarity tiers
**Status:** Proposed
Common, Uncommon, and Rare clients. The proposed lineup is in `content-brainstorm.md`, section 10.

### D-032 · Job board at run start
**Status:** Proposed
Choose from two or three contracts, each one a client plus a lot.

## Parked

- **Renovation mode:** the client lives in the house while you do renovations and additions. Revisit once the core is fun.
- **Upstairs floor:** revisit after the basement.
- **Tour-order scoring:** the walkthrough as a scoring chain, where some rooms boost every room visited after them. Interesting, but hard for players to predict.
- **Company HQ screen:** a visual home for meta-progression.

## Open questions

- Art direction and tone: pixel art or flat illustration; cozy or tongue-in-cheek.
- Sound and music approach.
- Exact numbers. `jam-scope.md` has placeholders to tune with playtests and simulated runs.
- Score name (D-019).
