# Open House — Decision Log

Our game jam entry for the theme **"It's a house."** A one-week jam with friends, built with Claude Code.

**How to use this file:** each entry is one decision with a status. Update the status instead of deleting entries. When a decision changes, mark the old entry *Superseded* and point to its replacement.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Accepted | Agreed; build on it |
| Proposed | Suggested, waiting on a yes or no |
| Parked | Good idea, deliberately deferred |
| Open | Needs a decision |

## The game in one paragraph

You run a home-building company. Each run is one contract: one client, one plot of land, one house. Every week you place one piece (a room or a yard feature), and every piece on the lot earns score each week based on what it touches. Every few weeks there's a milestone with a target that rises each time; miss it and the client fires you. Hit it with weeks to spare and you choose between completing the milestone early for a bonus or using the remaining weeks to keep building. Between milestones you spend budget in a shop. Each client judges the house in their own way, and change orders shake things up mid-run.

## Accepted

### D-001 · Concept: Open House
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** A roguelite house-building engine-builder: place rooms and yard pieces on a lot, chase combos, hit rising targets.
**Why:** The best hook for the build risk of the four pitches, and the most literal take on the theme.
**Considered:** *Do Not Disturb* (you are the house, protecting your sleeping family from burglars), *Chicken Legs* (FTL-style walking house), *Housesitter* (anomaly hunt).

### D-002 · Top-down map view
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** The lot is shown top-down on a grid, similar to Combolands.

### D-003 · One client, one lot, one house per run
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** The house persists through every milestone of a run, and the client stays the same.
**Why:** Players can commit to a specialized build, no later evaluator punishes earlier choices, and each run has a clear identity.
**Considered:** A new buyer every round. Rejected because it forces generic houses and needs a story patch for why buyers don't just buy the house.

### D-004 · Weekly earning
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Each week is one turn in which you place one piece. Every placed piece earns every week, so early placements earn more over time.
**Amended by:** D-036: a week may also be passed without placing (confirmed 2026-11-04). D-050 and D-051 (Accepted 2026-11-05): a week's turn can instead be installing a drawn fixture; tools and bought fixtures are free actions, and no week ever gets a second piece.

### D-005 · Milestones with rising targets
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Every few weeks the accumulated score must reach a target, and targets rise each milestone. Missing one ends the run (the client fires you).
**Amended by:** D-041 (Accepted 2026-11-04): 2 overtime weeks are spent before a miss ends the run.

### D-006 · Early completion
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Once a milestone's target is met with weeks to spare, the player can complete it early for a bonus (budget for each week saved, plus a score bonus) or keep building through the remaining weeks to get more pieces down.
**Why:** A real greed-versus-growth decision. Modeled on Combolands' "Complete milestone early" button (see `research.md`).
**Proposed addition:** an auto-complete toggle for players who want to skip the decision. *(Resolved by D-040: included, off by default.)*
**Amended by:** D-040 (Accepted 2026-11-04): the skipped weeks fast-forward, and the reward scales with the phase.

### D-007 · The yard is part of the build
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** The lot includes both the house and the yard. Yard pieces are first-class, and every tile is a choice between house and yard.

### D-008 · Open House is its own game, not a reskin
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Keep these house-specific ideas central:
- Rooms have real floor-plan shapes.
- Groups of rooms score like poker hands (e.g., a Suite, a Full House).
- Scoring follows real-world floor-plan intuition (bedrooms want quiet, kitchens want dining rooms), and clients bend those rules.
- "-house" outbuildings: doghouse, treehouse, greenhouse, and so on.

### D-009 · Framing: you're the building company
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** The player runs a home-building company that takes contracts. Each contract is a plot of land with unique features plus a client with specifications. Not a realtor or sales game.

### D-010 · Clients differ in flavor, not necessarily difficulty
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** A client like the vampire should feel different from a typical 4-bed, 2-bath family, not just harder.

### D-011 · Change orders
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Mid-run, the client makes new requests that push the player to adapt.

### D-012 · Crews
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** At the start of a run the player picks a builder or crew with its own strengths and focus (the equivalent of Combolands' guilds).

### D-013 · Shop between milestones
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Budget earned from milestones and early completions is spent in a shop between milestones.
**Amended by:** D-046: economy pieces are a budget source too (confirmed 2026-11-04). D-049 and D-051 (Accepted 2026-11-05): finds, selling for half the list price, the shop's skip reward, and Savings Account interest are budget sources too.

### D-014 · v1 is building for the client
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** The first build focuses on constructing the house for a client. Renovation modes wait (see Parked).

### D-026 · Everyday clients are common; eccentrics are rare
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04
**Decision:** Most clients have everyday but varied needs (a family, dog owners, a remote worker, a minimalist). Eccentric clients like the vampire show up rarely, as a fun surprise.
**Why:** Varied needs drive replayability, and rare eccentrics stay special.

### D-033 · Render with Preact and the DOM, not Phaser
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04 (confirmed by the team)
**Decision:** Preact renders everything, including the board:
- a CSS grid for input
- an absolutely positioned layer for pieces
- SVG outlines
- the Web Animations API and CSS for juice, plus one canvas for particles

The board sits behind a small `BoardView` interface, so Phaser could replace just the board later.
**Why:** Most of the screen is panels (hand, top bar, checklist, shop, job board, end screen). The board is 144 cells and turn-based. One renderer avoids a canvas-to-DOM bridge right where the core interaction happens. About 9 kB gzip against 357 kB for Phaser 4.
**Considered:** Phaser 4 board + DOM panels (runner-up), PixiJS + DOM, all-Phaser. Amends the Phaser hint in D-027.
**Note 2026-11-05:** with the 24×24 lot (D-048) the board is 576 cells. Preact and the DOM, with no Phaser, still holds.
**Amended by:** D-049 (Accepted 2026-11-05): the input bullet changes from a CSS grid of cells to pointer arithmetic on one element, and terrain becomes one layer that re-renders only when terrain changes.
*Proposed amendment (D-057, 2026-11-05):* for pixel art, terrain is drawn into one canvas layer and pieces use a sprite atlas. SVG stays for outlines and highlights.

### D-040 · Early completion fast-forwards the rest of the phase
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04 (confirmed by the team)
**Decision:**
- Completing a milestone early fast-forwards its remaining weeks (every week of the phase not yet tallied): pieces keep earning and timers keep ticking, but no hands are drawn and nothing is placed.
- The reward is budget per week saved plus a score bonus of a percentage of this phase's earnings per week saved, tuned per phase by the sim.
- It's offered in every phase, including the last.
- Auto-complete exists but is off by default.

**Why:** D-006 doesn't say what happens to the skipped weeks. If they were simply lost, each would cost about 5% of the final score, and +1 budget could never pay for that; Combolands players mostly ignore its version. With fast-forward, you trade placements for budget. That favors building early and cashing out late, and it shortens sessions.
**Considered:** Losing the weeks, with a much larger reward.
**Changes:** D-006 (Accepted), by defining what it leaves open, and resolves its proposed auto-complete toggle.

### D-041 · Overtime weeks
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04 (confirmed by the team)
**Decision:** Each run has 2 overtime weeks.
- When a phase ends short of its target, they're spent automatically, one at a time.
- Each is an extra placement week appended to that phase, with its own hand. The next phase still gets its full 4 weeks.
- The run ends only when the target is still missed after the last overtime week.
- A clock counter shows how many are left.

**Why:** A hard fail with few recovery tools is the top complaint about Luck be a Landlord, and Combolands' version of this pool is a big part of why reviewers call it relaxed.
**Changes:** D-005 (Accepted). Missing a milestone still ends the run, but only after overtime runs out.

### D-042 · Run length: 7 milestones × 4 weeks
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-04 (confirmed by the team)
**Decision:** Keep the 7 construction-phase milestones, with 4 weeks each instead of 6: 28 placements, about 20 minutes. Weeks per milestone is a number in `balance.ts`.
**Why:** 42 placements plus 6 shops is 35–45 minutes for a first run, longer than most jam players give a game, and a late loss wastes 25 minutes. A shorter run also leaves the lot about 60% full instead of nearly full (on 12×12; on the 24×24 lot of D-048, 28 placements cover about 15%, and D-049 handles emptiness instead of fill).
**Changes:** D-029 (Proposed), its starting numbers.

### D-048 · Lot size: 24×24
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (requested by the team)
**Decision:** The lot is 24×24 tiles instead of 12×12. Width and height are separate numbers in `balance.ts`, and the rules work at any size.
**Why:** A yard needs room to feel like a yard, and terrain such as a creek needs room to be interesting. The game is turn-based and light, so where fun and performance pull apart, fun wins. A finished house covers roughly 15% of the lot, so tiles stop being scarce; what's scarce is the 28 placements and the best tiles. D-007 still holds in that sense: each placement is a house-or-yard choice.
**Considered:** 12×12, the original placeholder. 20×20 and 24×18 (24×18 fits a 16:9 screen with bigger cells); both stay a one-line change if the M1 playtest finds the cells too small or the lot too empty.
**Changes:** D-029 (Proposed), its lot size. The terrain and rules that make the size work are in D-049. D-033's reasoning cites 144 cells; Preact and the DOM still hold at 576, and its input bullet changes through D-049.

### D-049 · Terrain and big-lot rules
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (confirmed by the team)
**Decision:**
- **Terrain:**
  - woods (clusters of Trees) and lone Trees
  - a creek on most lots
  - a pond, boulders, and the sunny side
  - from M3b, two kinds of **finds**: the Old Shed (demolish it for a random tool) and Time Capsules (the first piece built over one pays budget)

  Terrain covers about a fifth of the lot. Each kind is a `FeatureDef` in `src/content`.
- Water bodies count once as a neighbor. Each Tree tile counts separately, so effects that count Trees or views have a cap.
- Only a Driveway can be built over the creek (a culvert), so the house sits on one bank but can still have a Garage.
- The lot edge bounds a fenced yard like a wall, so a house near an edge makes a cheap fenced yard. A fenced yard must also border the house, so a lone Fence in a corner doesn't count.
- The front yard is counted by rows (nearer the street than the house's front), so it stays a real position on a wide lot.
- Bigger yard shapes: the Lawn is 2×2, the Fence comes as a 1×4 and a 5-tile L, and the Driveway as 1×3 and 1×5.
- The board draws terrain as one layer that re-renders only when terrain changes, and maps the pointer to a cell by arithmetic. A camera fits the lot to the screen, with zoom and pan.
  *Proposed amendment (D-057, 2026-11-05):* for pixel art, the camera zooms in whole-number scales by re-laying out the board rather than with a CSS transform, which blurs canvases in Safari.
- The sim ranks candidate placements by a cheap local score and scores only the top few exactly.

**Why:** On 24×24, 28 placements cover about 15% of the lot. Without dense terrain and bigger yard pieces, three things go wrong:
- the lot feels empty
- Fences take too many placements
- counting Trees per tile makes pieces at the edge of the woods too strong

With these rules, where to put the house becomes the run's first big decision.
**Considered:** Revealing the lot in stages. A footbridge across the creek (Stretch). A hill that gives a View (Stretch). Special features such as an ancient oak or the neighbor's cemetery (Stretch, and cheap now that terrain is data).
**Changes:** D-013 (Accepted): finds are a budget source. D-033 (Accepted): its input layer, from a CSS grid of cells to pointer arithmetic. D-035 (Proposed): terrain neighbors. D-046 (Proposed): the fenced-yard rule. `content-brainstorm.md` §2 and §4 (a Draft): new terrain and bigger yard shapes.

### D-050 · Fixtures are in the jam build
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (requested and confirmed by the team; `jam-scope.md` listed fixtures as Stretch)
**Decision:**
- A fixture is a card. It's installed in a piece you've already placed, such as a Fireplace in a room or a Sprinkler in a Lawn. Fixtures show up in the weekly hand from phase 2, and in the shop.
- Installing a **drawn** fixture is the week's turn, instead of placing a piece. A fixture **bought** in the shop goes into your supplies and installs as a free action: you paid budget instead of a week.
- One fixture per piece; installing a new one replaces the old. A fixture goes when its host is demolished.
- A fixture's effects are modifiers on its host, so a new fixture is data.
- Core: 10 fixtures, 7 for rooms and 3 for the yard (Appendix B of `implementation-plan.md`).
**Amended by:** D-056 (Accepted 2026-11-05): the Rare Chandelier, a ×Mult source, makes 11 fixtures (8 for rooms).

**Why:** Fixtures make the house better without making it bigger, so late placements still matter (the snowball problem in `implementation-plan.md` §2), and every hand offers a choice between growing and improving. Combolands' closest equivalent is its single-building upgrades, which are bought consumables. Floor Plan draws features into existing rooms the way our hands draw fixtures. The cost decides the split: a drawn fixture costs a week, so it competes with a piece, and a bought one costs budget, so it's free to install.
**Considered:** Every install as a free action, which turns the hand into a shopping list. Every install costing a week, which makes bought fixtures a poor buy. Fixtures only in the shop.
**Changes:** D-004 (Accepted): a week's turn can be an install instead of a placement. A week never gets a second piece. `jam-scope.md`: Fixtures move from Stretch into the jam build.

### D-051 · The shop: five kinds of goods
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (confirmed by the team)
**Decision:**
- **Five kinds of goods:**
  - **Blueprints:** run-long rule-benders in 4 slots, Common, Uncommon, or Rare
  - **Pieces:** special pieces, which go into the reserve
  - **Fixtures:** go into supplies and install for free (D-050)
  - **Tools:** one-shot free actions, such as moving a piece, a week's bonus, or a redraw from special pieces. They share the 3 supply slots with fixtures. None adds a second piece in a week or an overtime week.
  - **Company upgrades:** permanent rule changes, one offered per visit from the second shop
- **Crates:** pick-1-of-3 packs of blueprints, fixtures, or pieces. The first shop always gives a free crate of Common blueprints.
- **Services:** +1 reroll and +1 demolition, whose prices rise with each purchase for the rest of the run.
- **Every visit:**
  - fixed category slots
  - one item at half price
  - a refresh whose price rises within the visit and resets at the next
  - selling blueprints and supplies for half their list price
  - offers you can't take (a full slot, a blueprint you own) are greyed out, and an opened crate can be discarded
  - a small reward for leaving without buying
- **Rarity:** weights shift toward Rare in later shops, and rarity is shown on every blueprint, fixture, and tool.
- **Core catalog:** 16 blueprints, 10 fixtures, 9 special pieces, 8 tools, 7 upgrades, and 4 crates (Appendix B of `implementation-plan.md`). Five of the special pieces (Sunroom, Hot Tub, Fire Pit, Henhouse, Birdhouse) were Stretch in `content-brainstorm.md`.
- The shop is open in every run, including the first.
**Amended by:** D-056 (Accepted 2026-11-05): 18 blueprints, 11 fixtures, and 12 tools from 7 kinds (the Remodel Plans level sets); It's a House and Rush Order become +Mult, and Last-Minute Push becomes ×Mult.

**Why:** The team asked for much more variety. Combolands' shop mixes passives, consumables, single-building upgrades, and packs, with stock that grows over a run. Balatro, Slay the Spire, and others add the patterns that make each visit feel different: guaranteed category slots, a sale, escalating rerolls, packs, and selling for half. Combolands players say its locked early shop made first runs drag. Each good reuses an existing building block or adds one small mechanism (a tool kind, a rule key, the crate screen), so the catalog stays data. Sources are in `research.md`'s 2026-11-05 update.
**Considered:** Freezing an offer for the next visit (Super Auto Pets, Backpack Battles), held for Stretch. A tool that plays a second piece in a week, left out because it would break D-004. An Overtime Voucher tool, left out because it would change D-041's 2 overtime weeks. "Sell-to-use" blueprints (Combolands' Loaded Dice), which tools cover more simply.
**Changes:**
- D-004 (Accepted): tools and bought fixtures are free actions during a week, and none adds a second piece.
- D-013 (Accepted): selling, the skip reward, and Savings Account interest are budget sources.

Also: D-036 and D-043 (Proposed), where hand size becomes the `handSize` rule (3 by default, 4 with Bigger Truck). D-046 (Proposed), where this replaces its shop defaults in Appendix A (one paid refresh per visit, no selling).

### D-052 · Schedule: feature freeze at the end of day 4
**Status:** Superseded by D-053 · 2026-11-05 (the team is two people with no day timeboxes)
**Decision:**
- **Day 1:** the scaffold and the vertical slice.
- **Day 2:** the full run, rules breadth, and the sim.
- **Days 3–4, in parallel:**
  - the economy, shop, fixtures, and tools
  - clients, sets, change orders, and crews
  - the UI shell, sound, the art pass (its direction chosen on day 2), hints, and sim reports
- **Feature freeze at the end of day 4.**
- **Days 5–6:** playtesting, balance, juice, art, and sound, with two builds a day. The final friend playtest is at midday on day 6, and content freezes at the end of day 6.
- **Day 7:** ship.
- Each milestone is timeboxed to its day. Unfinished work goes to the cut list instead of moving the freeze.

**Why:** The previous plan built features until day 5 and held one playtest, on the evening of day 6, which left no time to act on what friends found. This kind of game gets fun through tuning, and the sim and the daily link make tuning cheap once the systems exist.
**Changes:** D-029 (Proposed), its suggested build order.

### D-047 · Desktop first
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (confirmed by the team)
**Decision:**
- Designed for mouse and keyboard at a minimum of 1280×720, which is also the itch.io embed size, with fullscreen enabled.
- Rotate has an on-screen button.
- Tapping places a piece tentatively and **End week** commits it, so touch works too.
- Below about 900px wide, a "best played on a computer" notice replaces any attempt at a phone layout.

**Why:** Friends will open the link from a group chat, and the itch.io embed is a fixed size. Both need deciding before the layout is built. The team agreed on 2026-11-05 not to aim for mobile.
**Amended by:** D-057 (confirmed by the team 2026-11-05): the design target is 1920×1080, since most players have at least a 1080p screen. The whole 24×24 lot fits there at a crisp 2×. 1280×720 still works, by panning. An itch.io page is optional now that Pages hosts both builds (D-060); if we make one, its embed is 1600×900 with fullscreen.

### D-053 · A two-person, phased build with a playtest after each phase
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (requested by the team)
**Decision:**
- The team is two: the user and Claude. Claude implements; the user playtests, reviews, and decides.
- The build goes in phases, M0 to M7 (`implementation-plan.md` §7). M1 to M6 each end with something playable, a short list of playtest questions, and a fix pass before the next phase starts. M0 is setup, and M7 is the release.
- There are no day timeboxes. The phase order is the priority order, so stopping after any playtested phase leaves a working game.
- Before each playtest, Claude runs the tests and the sim, plays a quick run in the browser pane, and writes a short note on what to try.

**Why:** The other jam members are building their own games, so there are no parallel tracks to coordinate. There's until next week to build and playtest before sharing with the larger group, and playtesting at every phase catches what isn't working while it's still cheap to change.
**Changes:** Supersedes D-052. D-029 (Proposed): its suggested build order.

### D-054 · Branches: develop and main
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (requested by the team)
**Decision:**
- `develop` is cut from `main`, and all work lands there.
- Each phase gets a branch off `develop` (for example `phase/m1-slice`), merged into `develop` by PR after its playtest.
- A release merges `develop` into `main` with a tag (`v0.1`, `v0.2`, …). Only `main` deploys to GitHub Pages.
- CI tests every push and PR to both branches.
- Playtests run locally from `develop` or a phase branch.

**Why:** Keeps `main` and the public link stable while work is in progress, and makes each phase one reviewable diff.
**Changes:** D-034 (Proposed): its hosting bullet.
**Amended by:** D-060 (Accepted 2026-11-05): Pages also serves `develop` at `/dev/`; `develop` is the GitHub default branch; releases are PRs from `develop` into `main` that the user opens and merges, and tagging is optional.

### D-060 · GitHub Pages: releases at the root, develop at /dev/
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (requested by the team)
**Decision:**
- **Two builds on one GitHub Pages site:**
  - `main` at the root: https://swalliso.github.io/house-game/
  - `develop` at `/dev/`: https://swalliso.github.io/house-game/dev/, a work-in-progress build that can be shared with other jam members
  - before the first release, the root shows a short placeholder that links to `/dev/`
- **One deploy job builds both:** a push to either branch runs it. It builds both branch tips into one Pages artifact, because a Pages site holds one artifact at a time. Vite's relative `base: './'` lets the same build work at either path.
- **Saves stay separate:** both builds share one origin, so saves and settings are namespaced by channel (`main`, `dev`, `local`). The build label shows the channel and the short SHA.
- **`develop` is the GitHub default branch,** so PRs, and new work generally, target it.
- **Releases are manual:** the user opens and merges a PR from `develop` into `main` at a good point. A tag (`v0.1`, …) is optional.
- **The `github-pages` environment allows both branches to deploy.** By default it allows only one, and a deploy from the other branch fails with an "environment protection rules" error.
- Local playtests still work too: `npm run dev`.

**Why:** The team wants a link for other jam members while the stable link stays on releases. Building both branches into one artifact is the simplest way for one Pages site to serve two branches.
**Changes:** D-054 (Accepted): Pages and the release flow. D-034 (Proposed): hosting.

### D-061 · Branch protection: develop and main change only by pull request
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (requested by the team)
**Decision:**
- Two repository rulesets, "develop: changes by pull request" and "main: releases by pull request". On both branches:
  - no deleting the branch, and no force pushes
  - changes arrive only through pull requests; nobody pushes directly
  - a code owner's review is required. `.github/CODEOWNERS` makes the user (`@Swalliso`) the owner of every file.
  - the CI job `test` must pass
- **`main` takes merge commits only,** so `develop` stays an ancestor of `main` and release PRs never re-show changes that were already released. `develop` takes any merge method.
- **The repository admin (the user) may bypass these rules only inside a pull request:** they can merge a PR that lacks the review, but nobody can push straight to either branch.
- **Claude pushes with the user's account,** and GitHub doesn't let an author approve their own PR. So Claude's PRs also need that bypass: the user ticks "Merge without waiting for requirements to be met". Claude never merges PRs; the user does.
- **Nobody else can push anyway:** the user is the only collaborator, and outsiders can only fork and open PRs, which need the user's review.
- CODEOWNERS reaches `main` with the first release PR. Until then nothing on `main` changes except through a PR the user merges.

**Why:** The repo is public, and the user wants to be the gatekeeper of every change. The rules turn the agreed workflow (D-054, D-060) into something GitHub enforces rather than a promise: no accidental pushes or force pushes to the two long-lived branches, CI before every merge, and the code owner on every change.
**Considered:**
- Requiring an approval with no bypass: it deadlocks, since an author can't approve their own PR.
- A separate GitHub account for Claude, so the user can approve its PRs normally: possible later, if the bypass click gets old.
- Requiring branches to be up to date before merging: it would force merging `main` back into `develop` after every release.

**Changes:** D-054 and D-060 (Accepted): now enforced by rules.

### D-019 · Score name
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (chosen by the team)
**Decision:** The week's three layers (D-056) are **Comfort** (what pieces earn; blue), **Charm** (the additive multiplier; rose), and **Sparkle** (the rare ×Mult; gold). The score is **Wow**: each week's total and the run total. In the tally: "Comfort 240 × Charm 2.5, Sparkle ×2 = 1,200 Wow". The code keeps the neutral names `points`, `mult`, `xMult`, and `total`.
**Why:** Three distinct words avoid Balatro's +Mult and ×Mult confusion, and Wow was already the working name. Alternatives considered: Delight, Hearth, Appraisal (`implementation-plan.md` §12). It can still change after a playtest.

### D-056 · Scoring is Points × Mult, with rare, planned ×Mult
**Status:** Accepted · 2026-11-05 (the team's request, and the model confirmed by the team). The numbers are placeholders for the sim.
**Decision:**
- A week scores **Points × Mult**:
  - **Points:** what the pieces earn, plus each held set's Points
  - **Mult:** starts at ×1 and adds +0.25 per spec met, each held set's Mult, and a few +Mult blueprints and tools
- **×Mult** sources each multiply the week's Mult once, however many pieces trigger them, and distinct sources multiply each other. They're rare and each needs a setup:
  - the Full House set (×2)
  - three Rare blueprints: Last-Minute Push (×2 in a phase's last week), Model Home (×(1 + 0.1 per piece with a fixture)), and Ahead of Schedule (×(1 + 0.2 per milestone completed early))
  - one Rare fixture, the Chandelier (×1.25 while its room is in an Entertainer)
- **Sets work like poker hands:** each pays Points and +Mult every week, rising with difficulty. Four Remodel Plans tools level a set type for the rest of the run, like Balatro's Planet cards.
- Per-piece percentage bonuses still add, as in D-037.
- The order is fixed (+Mult, then ×Mult), and each layer gets its own color and sound.

**Why:** In Balatro and Combolands, big moments come from multipliers. Making them powerful but rare and conditional means you plan for them rather than stumble into them. Balatro puts ×Mult on 70% of its Rare jokers and 3% of its Common ones, and its players confuse +Mult with ×Mult when they look alike. Keeping multiplication in one weekly step avoids D-037's ×15–×36 per-piece blowups. Targets come from the sim's median curve, which ×Mult may steepen.
**Changes:**
- D-037 (Proposed): the week's formula.
- D-021 (Proposed): how specs pay.
- D-019: the layers' names (Comfort, Charm, Sparkle, Wow).
- D-050 and D-051 (Accepted): adds the Chandelier (11 fixtures), Model Home and Ahead of Schedule (18 blueprints), and the Remodel Plans tool kind (12 tools); turns It's a House and Rush Order into +Mult; turns Last-Minute Push into ×Mult.

## Proposed

### D-015 · Start small, grow into the corporation
**Status:** Proposed
The company starts as a two-person outfit with a pickup truck, and growing it is the meta-progression. Players name their company, and the name shows up next to shared scores.

### D-016 · Unlocks over power
**Status:** Proposed
Meta-progression unlocks new crews, clients, and pieces rather than permanent stat boosts, so runs stay challenging. The currency is Reputation, earned from finished jobs, with a bonus for early completions.

### D-017 · Difficulty is a separate setting
**Status:** Proposed
Contract difficulty tiers add HOA rules, rush jobs (fewer weeks), and tight budgets (a pricier shop), independent of which client you get.

### D-018 · Milestones are construction phases
**Status:** Proposed
Groundbreaking → Foundation → Framing → Roofing → Drywall → Finishes → Final Walkthrough. Each milestone is a client walkthrough.

### D-020 · Pieces built from tags and effect types
**Status:** Proposed
Every piece has tags (Quiet, Loud, Social, Wet, Sunny, Outdoor, Kid, Pet, Green, Dark, …) and effects built from a small shared set of effect types. Clients, change orders, HOA rules, and shop upgrades target tags, so new content is mostly data. See `content-brainstorm.md`.
See also D-038 (Proposed): the data format, piece-id targets, relational selectors, and four more effect kinds.

### D-021 · Client spec checklist
**Status:** Proposed
Each client has a short spec checklist (e.g., 4 Bedrooms, 2 Bathrooms, a Fenced Yard), and each item met multiplies weekly score. Together with the client's tastes, this is how clients judge the house differently.
See also D-037 (Proposed): spec bonuses add (+25% each) rather than compound. D-056 (Accepted 2026-11-05): each spec met adds +0.25 to the week's Mult.

### D-022 · Daily Lot
**Status:** Proposed
The same lot, client, and card draws for everyone each day, with a shorter run and a copyable result line for the group chat.

### D-023 · One extra floor at most for the jam: the basement
**Status:** Proposed
Floors are layers on the same grid with a floor switcher, with the other floor shown faded for reference. The staircase is a piece you draft. Basement only, and only as a stretch goal.

### D-024 · Endless mode after the Final Walkthrough
**Status:** Proposed
After winning, keep going with rising targets and more change orders. Nearly free if the milestone system keeps generating phases.

### D-025 · House data separate from run data
**Status:** Proposed
Keeps the door open for a future renovation mode that starts from an existing house.

### D-027 · Tech defaults
**Status:** Proposed
TypeScript + Vite. The game rules live in a pure TypeScript module with no rendering code, covered by unit tests, with a thin rendering layer on top (Phaser is a good fit for the board and animations; settle this during planning). Seeded randomness from day one. Static hosting (itch.io or GitHub Pages) so friends can play from a link. Where the repo's existing conventions differ, follow the repo.
Rendering settled by D-033 (Accepted 2026-11-04): Preact and the DOM, not Phaser. Versions and hosting: D-034 (Proposed).

### D-028 · Score accumulates across the run
**Status:** Proposed
One running total, with each milestone at a higher total, shown as a single progress bar with phase markers. Weekly earnings are never wasted, so choosing to keep building instead of completing early always adds to the total.

### D-029 · Jam scope and starting numbers
**Status:** Proposed
See `jam-scope.md` for what's in, what's stretch, what's out, placeholder numbers, and a suggested build order.
Amended by D-042 (Accepted 2026-11-04): 4 weeks per milestone instead of 6. Amended by D-048 (Accepted 2026-11-05): a 24×24 lot instead of 12×12; see also D-049 (terrain) and D-053 (the phased build), both Accepted. See also D-044 (Proposed): the sim moves to M2; D-046 (Proposed): early-completion reward numbers.

### D-030 · Placeholder art first
**Status:** Proposed
Build with simple shapes and labels until the core loop is fun, then do an art and sound pass. CC0 asset packs are fine for the jam.
*Refined by D-057 (2026-11-05): the final look is cozy pixel art, and placeholders are simple sprites in the final atlas format, so swapping in real art is free.*

### D-031 · Client rarity tiers
**Status:** Proposed
Common, Uncommon, and Rare clients. The proposed lineup is in `content-brainstorm.md`, section 10.

### D-032 · Job board at run start
**Status:** Proposed
Choose from two or three contracts, each one a client plus a lot.

### D-034 · Toolchain, hosting, and repo layout
**Status:** Proposed · 2026-11-04
**Decision:**
- npm and Node 26.
- TypeScript pinned to ~6.0, the last JavaScript-based compiler, verified with this stack.
- Vite 8, Vitest 5 with fast-check, Preact 10 (not 11, which is newer than Claude's training data), and Prettier.
- No ESLint: a DOM-free tsconfig plus a small test keep `src/rules` pure.
- One GitHub Actions workflow tests every push and deploys `main` to GitHub Pages; itch.io gets a manual upload for the jam.
- The design docs move into `docs/`, and a short `CLAUDE.md` points future sessions to them.

**Why:** D-027's defaults, with versions checked on 2026-11-04. Pages gives a live link without secrets.
**Amended by:** D-054 (Accepted 2026-11-05): work lands on `develop`. D-060 (Accepted 2026-11-05): Pages serves `main` at the root and `develop` at `/dev/`, and `develop` is the GitHub default branch.

### D-035 · Board rules: adjacency, lot features, one house
**Status:** Proposed · 2026-11-04
**Confirmed 2026-11-04:** indoor rooms must connect into one house. **Confirmed 2026-11-05:** the terrain-neighbor rules from D-049. The rest awaits plan approval.
**Decision:**
- Adjacency is orthogonal (no diagonals), and each distinct neighbor counts once.
- Each Tree tile is a Quiet, Green neighbor, so effects that count Trees have a cap. The Pond and the Creek each count once. The Street is one Loud neighbor along the bottom edge. Boulders and finds give nothing (D-049).
- If any indoor piece exists, a new one must touch one. Demolishing an indoor piece that would split the house isn't allowed.
- A Garage must also touch the street or a Driveway, and a Driveway must touch the street or another Driveway.

**Why:** Adjacency has to be fixed before any number is tuned. A connected house keeps the result looking like a house: Floor Plan and Combolands are both criticized for finished layouts that make no sense. It also gives exterior and interior rooms and the front yard a clear meaning.
**Considered:** Rooms anywhere; 8-way adjacency (Combolands).

### D-036 · Week flow
**Status:** Proposed · 2026-11-04
**Confirmed 2026-11-04:** Pass (amends D-004). **Confirmed 2026-11-05:** the free actions and hand size from D-050 and D-051. The rest of this entry awaits plan approval.
**Decision:**
- **Start of week:** transforms resolve, then a hand of distinct cards is drawn: 3 by default, set by the `handSize` rule (pieces, plus fixtures from phase 2; D-050). If nothing in the week's first hand fits, there's one free redraw.
- **During the week:** reroll, demolish, installing a fixture from supplies, and using a tool are free actions (D-050, D-051). Then place one piece, install a drawn fixture, or **Pass**. A placement stays tentative until **End week**, so undo is free.
- **End of week:** the new piece earns that same week. Scoring is a single pass, and no effect triggers another.

**Why:** Pass is needed for full lots and dead hands; Luck be a Landlord and Combolands both have one. Resolving transforms first means the preview always matches the tally. A single pass avoids Combolands' infinite-loop bug and its hidden trigger cap.
**Changes:** D-004 (Accepted). Each week is still one turn, but Pass places nothing.

### D-037 · Scoring math and the live preview
**Status:** Proposed · 2026-11-04
**Decision:**
- Each piece earns `floor((max(0, points) × max(0, 100 + Σ pct) + 50) / 100)` in integer math. Percentage bonuses add rather than compound, and "earns nothing" overrides to 0.
- Sets and specs are week-level terms: the week's score is Points × Mult (D-056), and each spec met adds +0.25 to Mult.
- The live preview shows the net change to the whole weekly total, with a +/− on every affected piece.

**Why:** Multiplying everything gives ×15 to ×36 on single pieces, which no target curve can absorb. A new piece changes its neighbors' earnings, so showing only its own number misleads. Refines D-021.
*Refined by D-056 (2026-11-05): the week's score becomes Points × Mult, with rare ×Mult sources. Per-piece percentages still add.*

### D-038 · Content is typed data
**Status:** Proposed · 2026-11-04
**Decision:**
- Pieces, features, sets, blueprints, clients, crews, change orders, and balance numbers are typed object literals in `src/content`.
- The rules implement a fixed set of building blocks: effect kinds, selectors (including relational ones such as "touching X" and "in the fenced yard"), piece and house conditions, and modifiers. An escape hatch covers true one-offs.
- Card text is generated from the data.
- Appendix B of `implementation-plan.md` writes every Core item in this format, without the escape hatch.

**Why:** Refines D-020. The Core content needs piece-id targets, relational selectors, four more effect kinds (per-tile, link, requires, conditional), and a separate set definition.

### D-039 · Randomness, run codes, replays
**Status:** Proposed · 2026-11-04
**Decision:**
- A hand-rolled `sfc32` generator.
- Every random decision derives a fresh stream from the run seed and a key (`lot/<attempt>`, `draw/<phase>/<slot>/<n>`, `shop/<phase>/<refresh>`, `crate/<phase>/<refresh>/<slot>`, `find/<x>,<y>`, `co/<phase>`, `jobs/<i>`).
- A run is `build + seed + setup + action log`, shared as a run code that replays exactly.
- Replays return the failing step instead of throwing, and a stale save starts a fresh run with a note.

**Why:** Keyed streams stop rerolls, overtime, or early completion from shifting later hands or the shop. That keeps bug reports reproducible and makes the Daily Lot (D-022) fair. The build stamp copes with deploys on every push.

### D-043 · Draws: distinct, weighted, phase-gated
**Status:** Proposed · 2026-11-04
**Decision:**
- Each hand holds `handSize` (3 by default) distinct card types: pieces, plus fixtures from phase 2 (D-050).
- Weights are integers (10 = normal) and come only from the piece, client, and crew, so they're fixed for the run.
- Special pieces have weight 0 unless a client or crew adds them.
- The client's spec pieces get +100%, and their signature special pieces (Library, Mudroom) are added at weight 20.
- Each piece has a `fromPhase`, so phase 1 draws only simple pieces. *Refined by D-055: simple pieces are weighted up early instead of complex ones being locked out; `fromPhase` stays only as a hard gate where a card can't work yet.*

**Why:** With uniform draws, the Hendersons' checklist takes a median of 23–24 weeks to complete, and about 6% of runs never finish it (estimate from a planning model). With weighting, the median is 14–16. The phase gate keeps the first run learnable.

### D-044 · The sim sets milestone targets
**Status:** Proposed · 2026-11-04
**Decision:**
- A minimal headless sim (random and greedy bots, about 200 runs) arrives in M2, not M5.
- Targets are a rising fraction of the median greedy-bot score at each milestone (about 0.6 → 0.85), times a per-client factor.
- Per-piece, per-client, early-completion, and shop reports come in M3 and M4. A planner bot and fuller sweeps come in M6, only as needed (D-053).

**Why:** Score grows roughly with the square of the week, so hand-picked targets will be wrong, and they shift with every content change.
**Changes:** D-029 (Proposed), its suggested build order.

### D-045 · First-run onboarding without saved progress
**Status:** Proposed · 2026-11-04
**Decision:**
- Every run, including the first, starts with the job board and a crew pick (D-012, D-032). On a first visit, the Hendersons and the General Contractor are marked "Recommended for your first job".
- Phase 1 draws mostly simple pieces (D-055).
- The shop opens after milestone 1 and change orders start after milestone 2.
- First-time hints are dismissible and remembered in the browser. That's UI only, not game state.

**Why:** A first run otherwise meets about 75 concepts. With no meta-progression in the jam, the run itself has to do the teaching.
**Considered:** A fixed first contract. Rejected because it changes D-012 and needs a saved run count.

### D-046 · Defaults for the rules the docs leave open
**Status:** Proposed · 2026-11-04
**Confirmed 2026-11-04:** economy pieces are a budget source (amends D-013). **Confirmed 2026-11-05:** the fenced-yard rule from D-049. The rest of this entry awaits plan approval.
**Decision:** Appendix A of `implementation-plan.md` lists every rule the docs leave open, with a default. The ones that change a number or content item in the existing docs are:
- **Budget:** economy pieces (paying every 2–3 weeks), change-order rewards, and set rewards are budget sources too (amends D-013).
- **Early completion reward:** placeholders of +2 budget and 10% of the phase's earnings per week saved, replacing +1 budget and an undefined "+10% phase bonus".
- **Lawn:** earns per adjacent Lawn (max 4) instead of per connected Lawn tile.
- **Specs:** must be positive achievements. "No Pool" and "no Garage" become tastes. Juniper's limit becomes the spec "a house of 4–8 rooms", plus a −10% taste per room over 8. Dale's "nothing Loud next to an office" ignores the street.
- **Jack-and-Jill:** stays a set, and the Bathroom's own Bedroom bonus is capped at one Bedroom.
- **Change orders:** one after each of milestones 2, 4, and 6, as `jam-scope.md` says. Requests and restrictions can be declined. Phase effects are announced and apply.
- **Fence:** earns per tile of the fenced yards it borders (capped in total). A fenced yard needs a Fence, at least 4 tiles, no contact with the street edge, and contact with the house (D-049).
- **Hallway:** links every room touching it, not just the rooms at its two ends.

**Why:** Each one fixes a contradiction or a degenerate case the design review found (see `implementation-plan.md` §2).
**Changes:** D-013 (Accepted), by adding budget sources; D-029 (Proposed), its early-completion numbers.

### D-055 · Simple pieces are more likely early in a run
**Status:** The direction is Accepted · 2026-11-05 (the team's request); the weights below are Proposed.
**Decision:**
- Every piece has a complexity from 1 to 3:
  - 1: plain earners (Bedroom, Kitchen, Lawn)
  - 2: conditions, regions, timers, or requirements (Garage, Herb Garden, Sapling)
  - 3: build-arounds (Fence, Hallway, special pieces)
- A piece's draw weight is scaled by a per-phase percentage: complexity 3 is at 5% in phase 1, 25% in phase 2, 60% in phase 3, and 100% from phase 4. The table is in `balance.ts` and Appendix A.
- Complex pieces can still appear early, just rarely. Client spec pieces keep their +100% on top.
- `fromPhase` stays only as a hard gate where a card can't work yet (fixtures, from phase 2).

**Why:** The team wants early phases to feel like Combolands: the simple, readable pieces show up first, and the game opens up as you learn it. Luck be a Landlord also offers mostly simple symbols early. Weighting rather than locking out keeps surprises possible.
**Changes:** D-043 and D-045 (Proposed), their phase gate.

### D-057 · Art: cozy top-down pixel art
**Status:** The direction is Accepted · 2026-11-05 (the team's request); the details below are Proposed.
**Confirmed 2026-11-05:** design for 1080p and up, since the team expects most players to have at least a 1080p screen. The whole lot fits at a crisp 2× there; smaller windows pan at 2×, with the Fit overview.
**Decision:**
- Cozy pixel art like Combolands: detailed enough to read what you're building, not so detailed that it distracts.
- 16×16 tiles, one shared palette of 24–32 colors, colored dark outlines, and light from the top-left.
- Rooms are shown as a top-down cutaway, with a floor and one key furniture sprite each. Installed fixtures show as small sprites. Roofs appear for the Roofing milestone and the end screen.
- Rendering is crisp at whole-number scales:
  - terrain in a canvas layer, and pieces from a sprite atlas
  - the camera zooms by re-laying out the board in whole steps, not with a CSS transform
  - the default zoom is at least 2×, panning when the lot overflows: at 1080p the whole lot fits at 2×, and at 1280×720 it pans
  - the one exception is the Fit overview, which shows the whole lot at the largest scale that fits, even a non-integer one (1.75× at 720p)
  - short juice tweens (pops, wobble, the celebration zooms) may use transforms
- If we make an itch.io page, its embed is 1600×900 with fullscreen. The main way to share is Pages (D-060).
- **Sources:**
  - Claude-drawn placeholder sprites in the final atlas format from M1.
  - **Final art (chosen by the team, 2026-11-05):** LimeZu's Modern Interiors and Modern Exteriors, which the user buys, plus LimeZu's free Serene Village (CC BY 4.0) for terrain and water. The license is paid, allows commercial use, forbids redistribution, and requires credit.
  - The full packs stay out of the public repo, in an `art-source/` folder in the main checkout that git ignores through the repo's local exclude file (and, from M0, `.gitignore`). Only the sprites we use are cut into `assets/`, which LimeZu has said is fine for open-source projects.
  - Every asset is recorded in `assets/licenses.json` and `CREDITS.md`.

**Why:** The team chose the look. The rendering rules come from browser constraints: pixel art blurs at fractional scales and under transforms in Safari. The licensing rules keep a public repo safe.
**Changes:** Resolves the art Open question. D-030 (Proposed): placeholders become sprites. Pending confirmation:
- D-049 (Accepted): the camera, from a CSS transform to re-layout in whole steps, with 2× panning rather than fitting at 1280×720.
- D-047 (Accepted): the 1080p design target. *Confirmed 2026-11-05.*
- D-033 (Accepted): terrain in a canvas layer and pieces from a sprite atlas.

### D-058 · Sound: calm music, rewards that escalate
**Status:** The direction is Accepted · 2026-11-05 (the team's request); the details below are Proposed.
**Decision:**
- **Music:**
  - calm: 70–90 BPM, sparse plucked and mallet instruments, rests
  - 3–4 synced stems that crossfade between screens
  - at least 2–3 tracks
- **Reward sounds:**
  - Points, +Mult, and ×Mult each have their own timbre
  - a pitch ladder that climbs the music's scale during each week's tally
  - escalation layers that fade in above the week's pace, and ducking under big jingles
- Our own small Web Audio wrapper, scheduled on the audio clock. ZzFX makes placeholders.
- CC0 sources first, CC BY with credit, and nothing non-commercial, share-alike, GPL, or ripped from other games.

**Why:** The team wants calm music with the dopamine moments given their due, like Balatro, Combolands, and Vampire Survivors. Details and sources are in `implementation-plan.md` §12.
**Changes:** Resolves the sound Open question.

### D-059 · Juice is a core feature
**Status:** The direction is Accepted · 2026-11-05 (the team's request); the details below are Proposed.
**Decision:**
- Reward feedback is built from the vertical slice on, not left for polish: the M1 slice has the tally director, the Points × Mult counters, the pitch ladder, and one big-week tier.
- M5 builds the full celebration ladder (`implementation-plan.md` §12):
  - four tiers against the week's pace (Normal, Good, Great, Huge), each with its own jingle
  - the glow during the preview
  - the pile of room sprites
  - the milestone moment
  - rarity glow on crates
- Every celebration is skippable after the first time it's seen. The tally speeds itself up, and there are speed settings.
- Reduce motion, screen-shake, flashing, and volume settings.

**Why:** In these games, the satisfaction of a big combo is the product. Research says medium-to-high juice beats both none and extreme, and that unskippable or slow celebrations wear thin after many viewings.
**Changes:** None to settled decisions. Juice isn't on the cut list.

---

## Parked

- **Renovation mode:** the client lives in the house while you do renovations and additions. Revisit once the core is fun.
- **Upstairs floor:** revisit after the basement.
- **Tour-order scoring:** the walkthrough as a scoring chain, where some rooms boost every room visited after them. Interesting, but hard for players to predict.
- **Company HQ screen:** a visual home for meta-progression.

## Open questions

- ~~Art direction and tone~~: decided by D-057 (cozy pixel art), 2026-11-05.
- ~~Sound and music approach~~: decided by D-058 (calm music, escalating reward sounds), 2026-11-05.
- Exact numbers. `jam-scope.md` has placeholders to tune with playtests and simulated runs.
- ~~Score name (D-019)~~: decided 2026-11-05: Comfort × Charm, with rare Sparkle, totaling Wow.
